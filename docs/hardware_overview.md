###XBee Smart Modem Socket

We've kept the XBee socket consistent with the XBee pinout, so this breakout board is backwards compatible.

###Power
USB-C Connectors
Input VCC Range: 3.3V-4.3V


###Qwiic Connector

The Qwiic connector on the SparkFun XBee Development Board provides power and I<sup>2</sup>C connectivity to Qwiic breakout boards.

###Buck Converter - AP63203

The AP63203 Buck Converter ensures appropriate power supply to the components of the board. VIN range is <b>3.8V-5.5V</b>. Output is 2A max.

###GPIO

We've broken out the XBee pins to plated through holes on either side of the board.

###Buttons 

There are two buttons - D0 and RST.

####PWR

Lights up when power is provided to the board. 

####ASC
The LED on the development board blinks when the XBee is registered to the cellular network.


<table class="tg" align="left">
  <tr>
    <th width="20%" align="center"><b>Blink</b></th>
    <th width="20%" align="center"><b>Timing</b></th>
    <th width="60%" align="left"><b>Meaning</b></th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="center">On</td>
    <td align="center">Solid</td>
    <td>Not joined to a mobile network</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="center">Double blink</td>
    <td align="center">Â½ second</td>
    <td>The last TCP/UDP/SMS attempt failed. If the LED has this
pattern, you may need to check DI (Remote Manager
Indicator) or CI (Protocol/Connection Indication) for the cause
of the error.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="center">Single blink</td>
    <td align="center">1 second</td>
    <td>Normal operation</td>
  </tr>
</table>


####RSSI 
Received Signal Strength Indicator - When configured, this LED reflects the received signal strength

RSSI PWM
The RSSI/PWM output is enabled continuously unlike other XBee products where the output is enabled for a short period of time after each received transmission. If running on the XBIB development board, DIO10 is connected to the RSSI LEDs, which may be interpreted as follows:


<table class="tg" align="left">
  <tr>
    <th width="20%" align="center"><b>PWM duty cycle</b></th>
    <th width="20%" align="center"><b>Number of LEDs turned on</b></th>
    <th width="60%" align="left"><b>Received signal strength (dBm)</b></th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="center">79.39% or more</td>
    <td align="center">3</td>
    <td>-83 dBm or higher</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="center">62.42% to 79.39%</td>
    <td align="center">2</td>
    <td align="left"> -93 to -83 dBm</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="center">45.45% to 62.42%</td>
    <td align="center">1</td>
    <td align="left">-103 to -93 dBm</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="center">Less than 45.45%</td>
    <td align="center">0</td>
    <td align="left">Less than -103 dBm, or no cellular network connection</td>
  </tr>
</table>


###Jumpers

####ALED/PLED

If power consumption is an issue (or if you just don't like the LEDs), cut the respective jumper to sever power to the LED. 

* PLED: Red
* ALED: Blue

####I2C 

The I<sup>2</sup>C jumper pulls the SDA and SCL pins to VDD (normally 3.3V) through two 2.2K Ohm resistors. If you have multiple Qwiic devices on the same bus you may want to disable these by opening the jumper (assuming they are also operating at 3.3V logic).
